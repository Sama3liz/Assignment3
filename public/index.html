                I’ve always been drawn to capturing the beauty around me through
                a camera lens. Whether it’s a candid moment or a picturesque
                landscape, photography allows me to freeze time. One of my most
                memorable photography experiences was during a hike up the
                mountains. As the sun began to set, the entire landscape turned
                golden, and I captured a shot that reminded me of nature’s raw
                beauty. That photo remains one of my favorites.

                Reading has always been my escape to different worlds and times.
                I once got so lost in a book during a train journey that I
                missed my stop! That’s the magic of a good book – it can
                transport you to another world, making time fly by. Whether it’s
                fiction or non-fiction, every book has something to teach me.

                Both photography and reading give me different perspectives –
                one through the lens of reality and the other through
                imagination. Together, they fuel my creativity and curiosity,
                helping me grow both personally and professionally. These two
                hobbies are an essential part of my life.
